## The Vision

In the rolling hills of Aveyron, where aligot has been stretching magnificently for centuries, a revolutionary idea was born: What if we built a cathedral entirely dedicated to the worship of aligot and saucisse? Not just any sausage, mind you, but the glorious, perfectly grilled saucisse de Toulouse paired with the silky, stretchy perfection that is aligot.
